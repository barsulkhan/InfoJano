# InfoJano Smart Master Project — Latest
Updated: 28 October 2026
Repository: https://github.com/barsulkhan/InfoJano
Live site: https://barsulkhan.github.io/InfoJano/

## Important working rules
- Continue from this file in a new chat. User works from Android mobile, prefers Bengali/Romanized Bengali and copyable links.
- Take the lead on technical tasks; explain only the essential steps the user must perform.
- Do not make speculative visual/code changes. Inspect existing code first, change the smallest relevant area, then verify the exact edited block.
- Preserve existing tools and workflows. In particular, don't break the ID Card Print Studio's manual crop, front/back selection, print dimensions, PDF/JPG export, or any unrelated document rules.
- After changing web assets, update service-worker cache version sequentially and record the change.
- Do not claim visual/PDF testing succeeded unless actually tested with the user's original file.

## Latest work: Ayushman card PDF crop and portrait quality
User showed an original Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY PDF and screenshots of InfoJano-generated card. Problems:
1. Back-side top heading/text was being clipped by automatic crop.
2. Portrait looked artificially dark/marked compared with the original PDF.

Changes committed to GitHub:
- Commit `2668461d0ddb1b6e35a8a8fd7943d482971eccdb`: extra top margin for Ayushman PDF Back crop detector.
- Commit `37c0c89493152178ab2829d8503c3d82a875a191`: service-worker cache bumped to v28.
- Commit `22d8f6f08fcbc836210d597d1eafd5345710c57d`: removed artificial darkening of Ayushman image pixels and removed contrast/saturation filter on rendered Ayushman PDF pages.
- Commit `8ebcb5b0109a9113c4c27b2b0149c42d11716968`: cache bumped to v29.
- Commit `fdc81b8475661d1e0e2d3290c8e1287db22f02f6`: changed Ayushman PDF handling to preserve each full PDF page as a manual-crop source, instead of relying on automatic ink-bound detection that could clip heading text.
- Commit `d8706663cf9b35f2d23440473b19ab2afdebd1ef`: cache bumped to v30.

Current live tool:
https://barsulkhan.github.io/InfoJano/id-card-print-studio.html

Current expected workflow for Ayushman PDF:
1. Select “Ayushman Bharat Card”.
2. Upload original PDF.
3. Choose the original full PDF page in “Original source to crop”.
4. Manually draw crop around only the complete top card face, including all orange header and bottom orange band, and excluding the instruction panel below.
5. Press “Use crop as Front” or “Use crop as Back”.
6. Inspect preview before exporting PDF/JPG.
The code now preserves original PDF page pixels (no artificial darkening/filter). The PDF branch should supply full page with label “full PDF page (manual crop)”. Need verify the actual live page reflects this after GitHub Pages deploy and the browser has refreshed; do not claim user’s PDF was directly tested by us.

Important caution:
- User previously said “file save carefully, avoid these mistakes”. Do not make further guess-based edits. Before editing again, fetch current `id-card-print-studio.html` and `sw.js`, inspect exact current blocks, then apply the minimal change.
- If user reports crop still wrong, ask for a screenshot showing the crop selection box or preview; adjust based on the exact evidence. Do not reintroduce automatic PDF crop without robust testing.
- When opening the live tool after deploy, advise a hard refresh/reopen or close/reopen tab to avoid stale service-worker cache.

## Site and SEO
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/barsulkhan/InfoJano
- Homepage: https://barsulkhan.github.io/InfoJano/
- Sitemap XML: https://barsulkhan.github.io/InfoJano/sitemap.xml
- Sitemap TXT: https://barsulkhan.github.io/InfoJano/sitemap.txt
- robots.txt: https://barsulkhan.github.io/InfoJano/robots.txt
- Google Search Console: https://search.google.com/search-console/
- Sitemap report: https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps

Search Console state as of 28 Oct 2026:
- Homepage inspection said “URL is on Google” / indexed.
- Page indexing report showed 21 indexed and 0 currently affected in one view.
- Sitemap reports for sitemap.xml and sitemap.txt showed “Couldn't fetch” / discovered 0, despite the XML opening normally in a browser and the sitemap URL live test saying “URL is available to Google”. The sitemap itself does not need to be indexed.
- Do not repeatedly resubmit or alter sitemap without inspecting a fresh detailed error; wait and recheck after a reasonable interval. Sitemap status is not proof that all site pages are broken.

## PWA
- Service worker cache is now `infojano-v30` after the latest crop/portrait changes.
- Manifest uses `/InfoJano/` start_url and scope, with app icons.
- If the latest code doesn't appear, refresh/reopen after deployment; service worker cache version is intended to trigger new assets.

## General project context
- InfoJano is a mobile-first global everyday utility/information portal, built and maintained from Android with limited budget.
- Main categories: calculators, AI & technology, money & finance, documents/online services, weather/daily info, education, jobs/careers, trending.
- User wants straightforward, accessible UI, PWA installability and SEO pages.
- Preserve existing tool pages/features and previous design decisions unless specifically asked to change them.
- Earlier master files: `InfoJano_Smart_Master_Project_COMPLETE_2026-10-20.md` and `InfoJano_Smart_Master_Project_LATEST_2026-10-25.md` (if present in chat/library). This file is the current checkpoint and focuses on changes through 28 Oct 2026.

## Next actions
1. Verify GitHub Pages has deployed commit `fdc81b8475661d1e0e2d3290c8e1287db22f02f6` and service worker `v30`.
2. User tests the Ayushman PDF using manual crop and checks full header/text and portrait in the preview/export.
3. If any clipping remains, inspect crop selection and source page screenshot first; avoid blind coordinate tweaks.
4. Continue Sitemap/Search Console follow-up separately; don't mix SEO changes into ID-card crop fixes.


## Update after master checkpoint: wider card cutting gap
Date: 28 October 2026
- User asked to increase the physical cutting gap between Front and Back card faces because the previous 5 mm gap was too narrow to cut comfortably.
- Updated `id-card-print-studio.html` commit: `816d4a0147ff955627b564bafb0c1743d0bc911e`.
- Gap is now 10 mm in the layout preview, PDF export and JPG export for side-by-side and stacked layouts.
- Fit validation was updated to account for the larger gap, so export should warn if cards no longer fit the selected paper.
- Updated service worker cache from `infojano-v30` to `infojano-v31` in commit `7e86fd3f65d8816ae929959ca477aff292e3c7b9`.
- Live test/physical print not yet verified. After GitHub Pages deploy, user should refresh/reopen the tool and inspect preview before printing at Actual size / 100%.

## Checkpoint update — 28 October 2026 (Sitemap alignment and Ayushman crop paused)
- User asked to pause the Ayushman card crop/print-size issue and continue other InfoJano work. Do not modify that crop workflow further until revisited.
- Current service-worker cache in `sw.js`: `infojano-v32`. The latest crop-related commit `333659471dac6e88a1fcc8c84e39c1822fe3686f` adds `trimAyushmanOuterWhitespace(canvas)` to trim blank margins accidentally included in a manual Ayushman crop; cache bump commit `2fc17654b3991f77a34e4ac08cd6790031314932`. This change has NOT been tested with the user's original PDF or physical print.
- Sitemap audit found `sitemap.xml` was missing `passport-photo-maker.html` and `pdf-to-jpg.html`, while `sitemap.txt` was missing `discount-pt-br.html` and `percentage-pt-br.html`.
- Fixed `sitemap.xml` in commit `3971ff4681f927480604ca8cbb1e5c5b5d833722` and `sitemap.txt` in commit `8a74342f2b6a25361dd4559288a226b7db4fcedd`. Both now list the same 28 page URLs.
- This is a repository content check only; live GitHub Pages deployment and Google Search Console sitemap status still need a follow-up check. Do not claim Google has fetched/indexed these pages. Recheck after deployment settles.
- Next non-Ayushman priorities: (1) verify the live sitemap URLs after deployment, (2) use Google Search Console Performance > Search results > Queries and Countries to guide SEO updates for Discount and Percentage calculators, (3) continue checking remaining SEO pages and homepage tool links without speculative redesign.

## SEO update — 29 October 2026
- User shared a Google Search Console Performance screenshot for the last 3 months: 2 clicks, 83 impressions, 2.4% average CTR, average position 30.4. Visible queries included “percentage calculator online” (2 impressions), “count percentage online”, “percentage calculator”, “percentage calculate”, “discount calculator online”, “count percentage”, “28 percent of 170”, and “sentence counter”. The screenshot shows only part of the query list; these are early, low-volume signals, not enough to infer long-term performance.
- Updated only SEO title and meta description on `discount.html` and `percentage.html` to align naturally with the visible queries. Existing calculator functionality, layout, canonical URLs, and on-page guides were not changed.
- Discount page commit: `8ffc49bcb96d7e1f1f1e9504b4ac8f80f81fc2d0`. New title: “Discount Calculator Online: Sale Price & Savings | InfoJano”.
- Percentage page commit: `178c9a8f58f9bda16bf072aa681acd57df153a00`. New title: “Free Online Percentage Calculator | InfoJano”.
- Updated service-worker cache to `infojano-v33` in commit `7664e075a0f9e944a5f6b742fffee70347eda4bd`.
- These are repository edits verified by fetching the updated file content; not yet confirmed deployed on GitHub Pages or measured for ranking/traffic impact. Recheck live page source after deployment and compare Search Console performance after several weeks.
